          <p>
            Democracy should be liquid, not all the votes on a goverment should be the same.
            Citizeens should be able to decide who has more decision power delegating their votes.
            Also, politicians must make public their opinion about every law and project they will
            vote, citizens should be invoolved on the debat so they can decide to who give their
            vote.

          <p>
            Money moovements should be transparent, politicians can't owe favors to corporations or
            rich people, they need to be free to take the best decisions for the people. Also, the
            money the goverment spends comes from oour taxes, is our mooney, so we need to see where
            it goes, why it goes there and what iis the projections. We are theiir investments, they
            need to show us the money.
